# Code Runner

**Code Runner** is a simplified online code editor that allows users to write, execute, and view the results of code snippets in different programming languages. The project uses the **Ace Editor** for syntax-highlighted code editing and the **OneCompiler API** for executing code. The editor is fully responsive and includes features for both desktop and mobile users.

## üåü Ideas for Expansion

Here are some suggestions to enhance the project:

1. **Support for Additional Languages**  
   - Add more popular programming languages like `Java`, `C++`, `C#`, `Ruby`, and `Rust`.

2. **Clipboard Integration**  
   - **Quick Copy Button**: Add a button to copy the code from the editor to the clipboard.
   - **Paste from Clipboard**: Allow users to paste code directly into the editor with one click.

3. **Auto-Formatting**  
   - Integrate a code formatter to automatically indent and style the code based on the selected language. Libraries like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [Esprima](https://esprima.org/) could be used.

4. **Customizable Themes**  
   - Allow users to switch between light and dark themes, or choose custom themes provided by Ace Editor.

5. **Save and Load Snippets**  
   - Add functionality to save code snippets locally or to the browser's local storage.
   - Allow loading saved snippets back into the editor.

6. **Shareable Links**  
   - Generate a sharable link that includes the code, language, and output. This link can be sent to collaborators or shared online.

7. **Download Code**  
   - Add a feature to download the current code as a file.

8. **Execution History**  
   - Maintain a history of executed code snippets with timestamps and results.

9. **Code Auto-Completion**  
   - Integrate auto-completion features for common syntax and libraries.

10. **User Authentication**  
   - Add user authentication and profiles for saving configurations, preferences, and snippets across devices.

11. **Integrated Documentation**  
   - Provide quick links to official documentation for the selected language directly in the editor.

12. **Self-Hosted**
   - Host backend with ability to compile code on our server without third-party apis.
